# ANFIS-Fuel-Injection-Estimator
A Python-based implementation utilizing PyTorch to construct an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).

The project acts as a Virtual MAF Sensor designed to provide backup telemetry for Engine Control Units (ECU). It addresses the critical issue of Mass Air Flow sensor malfunction by predicting the required fuel dosage in real-time based on indirect variables (RPM and TPS). This serves as a reliable fallback algorithm (Alpha-N strategy) ensuring vehicle safety and engine stability.
